Datasets and R code used for analysis in my master's thesis 'The Social Identities of Biden and Trump Sympathizers â€“ A Multilevel-Analysis of the Candidate Preference in the U.S. Presidential Election 2020'.

The 'data' folder contains all data necessary to replicate the results. It includes ANES 2020 Times Series data, US census data from 2020 aggregated by states, US Bureau of Labor Statistics unemployment data for 2020 aggregated by state, and FiveThirtyEight partisan lean data for 2020.
Additional information on the data can be looked up at the respective source.
The R script runs a multilevel random intercept model with predictors for candidate preference at the individual and state level. 
After setting the right working directory in the beginning, the script runs from top to bottom.
